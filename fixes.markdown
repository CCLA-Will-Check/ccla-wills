I’m getting an error on the front end when testing the “Register a Will”
form. They are being entered into the database alright, but the frontend
is still returning an error for some reason and not bringing people to a
confirmation page. Province/Country also appear to be required fields,
and should be marked with a * on the front end.
 
On the Find a Will page, I keep getting a “Please enter all required
fields” error even when I have everything filled out.

Can you tell me why I’m getting an error when trying to upload the
attached? Is it the date format? (Required format is YYYY-MM-DD)

Can you change the wording on the Register a Will page from “To upload
multiple wills, please download and use this template:”
 
to
 
“To register multiple wills, please download and use this template:”

Sorry one more thing – can you take off the “Change Status” button on
the confirmation page, so rando people can't change that. Also the:
“Thank you for your request. We will contact you within X business
days.” Should read “…two business days.”

For the Find a Will page, I think the problem is the date field being
not formatted correctly. Can you add “(YYYY-MM-DD)” to the label on the
front end so people know what format they have to use?
