I’m getting an error on the front end when testing the “Register a Will”
form. They are being entered into the database alright, but the frontend
is still returning an error for some reason and not bringing people to a
confirmation page. 

On the Find a Will page, I keep getting a “Please enter all required
fields” error even when I have everything filled out.

Can you tell me why I’m getting an error when trying to upload the
attached? Is it the date format? (Required format is YYYY-MM-DD)

Sorry one more thing – can you take off the “Change Status” button on
the confirmation page, so rando people can't change that.
